# Open Profiler Config

> Here is where the magic happens! Customize the [Open Profiler configuration](../../../../config/open-profiler.config.json) to make it uniquely yours. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Examine the structured format of the object by referring to the [OpenProfilerModel](../models/open-profiler.model.ts).
- If you don't want to display a section, simply leave it unfilled.
- The end date for experience and education is not mandatory. If applicable, you can leave it empty, and it will be displayed as "Present."
- If a badge you want isn't available on [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), consider using an alternative or skipping it.
- Load local images into the assets folder using relative paths.

Now, go ahead and let the world see your personalized Open Profiler configuration!
